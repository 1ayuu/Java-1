# Packages
- They are containers for classes.
- Package allows you to create a class named ABC, which you can store in your own package without concern that it will collide with some other class named ABC stored elsewhere.
- Java provides a mechanism for partitioning the class name space more manageable chunks. This mechanism is referred as paclkage.
- Package is both a naming and a visibility ‚è© "default" control mechanism.
