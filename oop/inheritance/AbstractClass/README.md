# Abstract Class

-  There are situations in which you will want to define a superclass that declares the structure of a given abstration without providing a complete implement ation of every method.
- That is, sometimes you will want to create a superclass that only defines a generalized form that will be shared by all of its subclasses, leaving it to each subclass to dills in the detail.
- One way this situation can occur is when a superclass is unable to create a meaningful implementation for a method.
