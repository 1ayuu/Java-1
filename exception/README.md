# Exception Handling

- Exception is an abnormal condition that arises in a code sequence at run time.
- When an exceptional condition arises, an object representing that exception is created and thrown in the method that caused the error.
- Exceptions can be generated by :

    - Java run-time system  
         Exceptions thrown by Java relate to fundamental errors that violate the rules of Java language or the constraints of Java execution environment.
    - Can be manually generated by your code.

    Java exception handling is managed via five keywords:  
    1. ```try```
    2. ```throw```
    3. ```catch```
    4. ```throws```
    5. ```finally```
